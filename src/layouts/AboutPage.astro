  "Modern wargames have grown dense and careful. Fastiloose! started as a reaction. It presents a way to bring back the quick-and-dirty fun of kitchen-table play, where rules are flexible, jokes are canon, and a character named Bob can achieve immortality by throwing sticks at mechs.";

  "It’s grid-based, designed for two players, and scales easily from half-hour duels to hour-long scrums. Every rule is written for hacking: change stats, add new gear, invent your own factions. The system will hold.";

  "Fastiloose! thrives on community mischief. Joke teams, house rules, and home-printed cards are the lifeblood of the game. If your table invents something ridiculous, congratulations: you’re doing it right.";

const aboutDescriptionText4 =
  "Fastiloose! was written, tested, and occasionally broken by Alexander Gorham, a designer who believes rules should be read in the same tone as good conversation; clear, clever, and never afraid of a bad joke.";
