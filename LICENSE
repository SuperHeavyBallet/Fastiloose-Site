Fastiloose! is a trademarked game system. The name Fastiloose!™ and its associated branding may only be used with permission.

The core mechanics of the Fastiloose! system are released under this open license. You are free to:

Use the rules in your own games, expansions, or settings.

Publish material that builds on the Fastiloose! System Reference Document (SRD).

Distribute your work for free or for profit.

The following conditions apply:

You must keep the Fastiloose! SRD intact and unaltered when bundling it. If you wish to change or rewrite the rules text, you must present your own system document without using the Fastiloose! name or trademark.

Any product using the Fastiloose! rules may not claim to be an “official” Fastiloose! product without explicit permission. *Get in touch to request this, I am happy to support other quality products.*

In short: the rules are free, the name is not. Build, remix, and expand—but respect the Fastiloose! trademark and SRD integrity.
